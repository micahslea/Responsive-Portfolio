          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <img src="assets/images/Micah_Lea.jpeg" />
          <p>
            Micah is just beginning his coding adventure and is currently
            enrolled in Vanderbilt Universityâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. He is excited
            to gain knowledge, experience, and to be surrounded by top-notch
            instructors and students.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has been married to his beautiful wife, Candi, since November of
            2015. Together, they have a dog, Maddie, and two cats, Cuse and
            Leona. Maddie is an Australian Shepherd-wolf mix; Cuse is an orange
            tabby who is obsessed with food and sleeps most of his day; and
            Leona is a one year old blind, Egyptian cat who wildly attacks her
            (usually) sleeping brother.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since his teens, Micah has sung and played guitar. His passion for
            music lead him to become a professional musician for several years
            and exposed him to live and studio sound engineering. Performing at
            the CMA Festival in 2015 as a backing vocalist and guitar player is
            one of his most notable professional achievements.
